# Etch-A-Sketch

This is the Etch-A-Sketch Project from 'The Odin Project' !

Doing this project helped me to improve my DOM manipulation skills, I learned a lot from this project.

How to draw :

Click once on the board to be able to draw,
then click again to stop drawing, it's very simple !

I will update this project as I go along to make it better!

Enjoy and thank you !
